Scripts and config files to unbind GPU on the fly based on mode using [Optimus Manager](https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager).

This allowed the use of GPU passthrough VMs with [Looking Glass](https://looking-glass.io/) without needing to restart the entire computer. Originally written for a System76 Oryx Pro (oryp8) back in 2021.

Note: GPU drivers are complex and aren't expected to be loaded/unloaded on the fly so bugs may occur.
